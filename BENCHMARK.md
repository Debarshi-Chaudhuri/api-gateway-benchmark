# API Gateway Benchmark Analysis: Tyk vs KrakenD

This document provides an analysis of performance benchmarks comparing Tyk and KrakenD API gateways.

## Benchmark Results Summary

Three benchmark runs were conducted with varying load levels:

### Run 1: 25,000 Requests
| Gateway | Requests | Success | Failed | Avg Time | Min Time | Max Time  | RPS    |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Tyk     | 25,000   | 25,000  | 0      | 54.37 ms | 50.43 ms | 139.55 ms | 913.21 |
| KrakenD | 25,000   | 25,000  | 0      | 58.41 ms | 50.70 ms | 158.17 ms | 849.67 |

### Run 2: 25,000 Requests (Higher Load)
| Gateway | Requests | Success | Failed | Avg Time | Min Time | Max Time  | RPS    |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|
| KrakenD | 25,000   | 13,562  | 11,438 | 61.41 ms | 50.97 ms | 314.03 ms | 610.03 |
| Tyk     | 25,000   | 10,000  | 15,000 | 54.55 ms | 50.45 ms | 124.42 ms | 847.28 |

### Run 3: 50,000 Requests (Highest Load)
| Gateway | Requests | Success | Failed | Avg Time | Min Time | Max Time   | RPS     |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|----------|----------|------------|---------|
| Tyk     | 50,000   | 10,000  | 40,000 | 53.59 ms | 50.47 ms | 94.38 ms   | 1354.86 |
| KrakenD | 50,000   | 13,739  | 36,261 | 62.52 ms | 50.62 ms | 1106.87 ms | 583.74  |

## Performance Analysis

### Tyk Gateway

#### Pros
- **Higher throughput**: Consistently delivers higher requests per second (913-1354 RPS vs KrakenD's 583-849 RPS)
- **Lower latency**: Maintains lower average response times (~54ms vs ~60ms for KrakenD)
- **More consistent performance**: Response times remain stable even under increased load
- **Better handling of peak loads**: Lower maximum response times in high-volume tests (94ms vs 1106ms)
- **Faster minimum response times**: Slightly faster baseline performance

#### Cons
- **Higher failure rates under load**: In the 50K request test, 80% of requests failed
- **Aggressive request shedding**: Appears to reject requests to maintain performance metrics
- **Performance prioritized over reliability**: Sacrifices success rate to maintain speed

### KrakenD Gateway

#### Pros
- **Higher success rates**: Processed more requests successfully in two of three test runs
- **More graceful degradation**: Attempts to process more requests even under pressure
- **Better reliability under load**: Lower percentage of failed requests in high-volume tests
- **Good baseline performance**: Perfect success rate in the initial 25K request test

#### Cons
- **Lower throughput**: Consistently fewer requests processed per second
- **Higher latency**: Average response times 4-9ms slower than Tyk
- **Performance degradation under load**: RPS drops significantly in high-volume scenarios
- **Latency spikes**: Much higher maximum response time (1106ms) in the 50K request test
- **Less consistent performance**: Greater variance between minimum and maximum response times

## Conclusions and Recommendations

Based on the benchmark results, the choice between Tyk and KrakenD should depend on your specific requirements:

- **Choose Tyk when**:
  - Raw performance and throughput are the highest priorities
  - Consistent low latency is critical
  - You have a robust retry mechanism in place for failed requests
  - Your architecture can handle request shedding gracefully

- **Choose KrakenD when**:
  - Success rate and reliability are more important than raw speed
  - Your system needs to process as many requests as possible, even at the cost of some latency
  - You prefer graceful degradation over aggressive request shedding
  - You have less control over the client's retry behavior

## Methodology Notes

The benchmarks were conducted using a simple testing environment with:
- A single backend HTTP service
- Multiple concurrent clients
- Various request volumes (25K and 50K)
- Default configurations for both API gateways with similar rate limiting settings (10,000 requests/second)

Results may vary depending on hardware, network conditions, and specific gateway configurations.
