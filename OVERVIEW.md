These assessments of Tyk and KrakenD are generally accurate, but I can offer some clarifications and additions.

## Tyk

### Pros
1. Cached responses are extremely fast
2. Uses Redis to store cache with detailed cache granularity 
3. Comprehensive circuit breaker, rate limiting, burst mode, and request validation support
4. User-specific rate limiting and validation is well-supported
5. Flexible response manipulation capabilities
6. Provides good UI dashboard for API management
7. Comprehensive gRPC support
8. Strong authentication options with multiple methods (OAuth, JWT, API keys)
9. Built-in developer portal for API documentation and onboarding
10. Analytics and detailed logging capabilities out of the box

### Cons
1. Requires Redis for distributed deployments, adding complexity
2. Potential bottlenecks through Redis for very large deployments
3. Horizontal scaling is more complex than KrakenD
4. Redis is an additional infrastructure component to manage
5. Non-cached performance is lower compared to KrakenD
6. Higher resource consumption overall
7. More complex configuration model
8. Enterprise features require commercial licensing

## KrakenD

### Pros
1. Non-cached responses are extremely fast
2. Supports circuit breakers, rate limiting, burst mode, and request validation
3. Excellent horizontal scalability
4. In-memory caching by default
5. Straightforward response manipulation
6. Basic gRPC support
7. Very low memory footprint
8. Configuration-as-code approach aligns well with GitOps
9. No external dependencies required
10. Excellent response aggregation capabilities from multiple backends

### Cons
1. User-specific rate limiting and validation is more difficult
2. API gateway configuration is node-specific by default (not globally synchronized)
3. In-memory caching requires monitoring memory usage
4. No built-in UI (though Grafana integration is possible)
5. Less comprehensive authentication options out of the box
6. No built-in developer portal
7. Limited centralized management for multiple gateway instances
8. Less advanced request transformation capabilities compared to Tyk

Writing Custom Go Plugins in Tyk[0]
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Plugins are added as a middleware layer. Can be added in request and response both to transform.
Plugins need to be compiled using PluginCompiler[1]
Different hook types to add plugin at different layers. Pre auth, post auth, response. [2]
Different hook capabilities based on where the plugin is header manipulation, body manipulation, etc [3]


Rate limiting [4]
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
`rate` which is the maximum number of requests that will be permitted during the interval (window). `per` which is the length of the interval (window) in seconds
Multi scopes for rate limiting API Level and Key level(User specific)
Tyk offers the following rate limiting algorithms:
 - Distributed Rate Limiter: recommended for most use cases, implements the token bucket algorithm
 - Redis Rate Limiter: implements the sliding window log algorithm
 - Fixed Window Rate Limiter: implements the fixed window algorithm
Offers throttling [5]
Circuit Breakers [6]


gRPC Support [7]
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

Can be used as a grpc proxy setup


Authentication [8]
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
OAuth2, JWT, Basic Auth, Auth Tokens, mTLS, hmac, etc
